# Rekall-Corporation-Penetration-Testing
A Penetration testing CTF where I used my offensive security skills to attack a fictional organization, Rekall Corporation, determine the vulnerabilities associated with their network and report them.
Used Kali Linux to perform various attacks on host machines and determine vulnerabilities.
